# YellowJacket — cross-platform desktop music player built with Wails (Go + Lit).
#
# This formula builds from source. The Wails toolchain (`go tool wails3`)
# resolves from the tool directives in go.mod, and Wails drives the frontend
# install/build itself (pnpm), so only the Go toolchain, Node, and pnpm are
# needed at build time.
#
# This file is the canonical source. On each tagged release, CI computes the
# tarball checksum and syncs an updated copy into the homebrew-yellowjacket tap
# repo (see .gitea/workflows/homebrew-formula.yml). The `version`/`sha256` lines
# below are what CI rewrites — keep them on their own lines.

  # WebKitGTK 6.0 by default (webkitgtk-6.0, gtk4, alsa-lib); v2's
  # webkit2gtk-4.1 + gtk3 is now only an opt-in `-tags gtk3` escape hatch and is
  # not what this formula builds.
